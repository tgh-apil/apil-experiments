        <h2><strong>We build a lot of stuff.</strong></h2>
        <p>Mostly physical models, but sometimes digital projects.</p>
        <p>Not all of our digital work is ready for a full release.</p>  
        <p>The purpose of this app is to exhibit some of these experimental concepts, and generate feedback from our users</p>
        <p><strong>Since these are experiments, expect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bugs</li>
            <li>Unoptimized code</li>
            <li>Possible memory leaks</li>
            <li>Odd interactions</li>
            <li>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of our apps will require you to login to take full benefit of their features.</p>
